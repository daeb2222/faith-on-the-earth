# Faith on the Earth – AI God Game

A real-time, AI-driven narrative experience where you play as a god, shaping the world through your decisions while a mischievous rival deity constantly interferes. Every turn is generated by LLMs, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same.

> **IMPORTANT:** > Before running the Unity game, make sure the backend is running.  
> You can start it instantly by double-clicking `backend_launcher.exe`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

**Run the backend with one click.**

In the root of the repository, run:

```bash
backend_launcher.exe

```

This executable automatically:

* Boots a self-contained Python 3.12 environment
* Installs `uv` if missing
* Syncs backend dependencies
* Starts the FastAPI server

**No Python installation required. No command line needed.** Just double-click → backend running.

The server will run at:

`http://127.0.0.1:8000`

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.12+
* `uv` package manager
* API keys for Mistral AI and Rodin AI (optional)

**1. Configure environment**

```bash
cd Backend
cp .env.template .env

```

Fill in your keys in the `.env` file:

```ini
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
RODIN_API_KEY=...

```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
uv sync

```

**3. Run the server**

```bash
uv run python main.py

```
